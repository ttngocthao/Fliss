                  The Fliss Fame Academy has helped over 4000 children over the
                  last seven years in a wide variety of ways! The staff and
                  children are like one big family having produced over 30 live
                  shows over the years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These include performing shows for the elderly and sick by
                  contributing towards McMillan cancer mornings helping to raise
                  cancer awareness and participating in events to save a local
                  church that was under threat and on the at risk register. Four
                  major dance competitions have been won with places gained on
                  major A list music videos including talent agency’s working
                  with artists such as Cheryl Cole, Professor Green, Dubsteps,
                  Wiley, Mr Zip and many more!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The children learn all new life skills that help build their
                  confidence and self esteem this in turn will help unearth
                  their hidden talents! But most of all we all have fun! Even
                  the shyest of children have shined so bright by the end of the
                  term! The Fliss Fame Academy holds a space for everyone in
                  2019!

                  At the end of Summer Term 2013 the kids performed a classic
                  musical The Wizard of Oz! This was an amazing performance by
                  all the children which included some of their tutors playing
                  some of the roles. The performance was so good they all
                  received a standing ovation at the end!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Included on the same afternoon was the very popular Cat Walk
                  fashion show created by Fliss, staff and all the children.
                  This gave everyone a chance to be models for the day and
                  represent their very own famous icon. Throughout the term
                  Fliss, tutors and the children chose a theme on famous icon’s
                  for their fashion show, each one of them had to design there
                  own fashion image that would represent their icon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Including in the show they had five outstanding Street Dance
                  performances which had been choreographed by Fliss and her
                  street dance support worker Chloe Cassidy. Individual and
                  group singing performances went down really well on the
                  afternoon, the children just love performing Lilly Santry
                  singing ‘Adele’ Someone Like You, Molly Mcdonaugh singing ‘Fix
                  You’ by Coldplay and Paige Tirebuck singing ‘Valerie’ by Amy
                  Winehouse.
