    "review": "My daughters shymaya and shamaya have been attending ffa for two years now , the journey my children have been on from this academy is outstanding ! They have now been sponsored by fliss because of their amazing gifts and talents , my children started off shy and with drawn and being a single mum I didn’t have money to buy them things or support them for natural things all children want to do outside school like trips , dance lessons , trips , parties , being brought to places to help change life’s like old people’s homes and taking part in performing for those very sick and unable to ever leave their homes , fliss and staff make amazing things happen in this academy , from skills finding their hidden talents even when the kids don’t know some of them their selves ! It’s an outstanding project , even after so many clubs closed down fliss fought so hard to keep it open even using her one money to help the love and support going for these children , my children have experienced so much and all I could say is this woman is like an angel sent to help people and families."

    "review": "I would like to highly recommend Fliss Fame Academy to all children. My child Natasha is ADHD and has Aspergers. Before attending the Fliss Fame Academy, she found it very hard to socialise and had no confidence. After attending FFA for a few weeks Natasha has made lots of friends and has taken part in 7 shows being the lead role in 4 of them. I have seen a major difference in my daughter. We love Fliss Fame Academy."

My son has been on 3 outings to Brighton Pier beach, Hampstead Heath Fair and St Mark's Water Park as a treat for good behaviour he would not of been able to visit these places and experience these beautiful activities in his life without Fliss Fame Academy."

    "review": "Good rising i would shout from the roof tops to promote for this academy! My name is Lucie. My son, Jesse is 13 years old and has just started boxing and street dancing at Fliss Fame Academy. Fliss doesn't just teach sports and perfroming arts , she really is so passionate about these kids lifes she is teaching, she goes that extra mile , really building the confidence in these kids. Jesse was getting into all sorts of problems out on the streets and was developing anger problems in school and at home. She has taught Jesse to meditate , release all his emotional traumas he had through mentoring him in her boxing classes. She has taught him balance ,fitness, dicipline ,release. She has given Jesse the opportunity to go out, go karting on trips, being very happy and settled with others now on the street managing himself in big groups and on his on ,this a major life skill Jesse needed to embrace and is like a brand new boy."
