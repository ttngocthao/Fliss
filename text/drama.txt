Drama is a discrete skill in itself (acting, theatre, refined skill) and therefore it is offered as a  ‘subject’ in secondary school. However Drama is also a tool which is flexible, versatile and applicable among a areas of curriculum. Through its application as a tool in the primary classroom, Drama can be experienced by all children.
Drama assists in the development of:

the use of imagination
power of creative self expression
decision making and problem solving skills
and understanding of self and the world
self confidence, a sense of worth and respect and consideration for others.
The SACSA Framework defines Drama as: ‘the enactment of real and imagined events through role-play, play making and performances, enabling individuals and groups to explore, shape and represent ideas, feelings and their consequences in symbolic or dramatic form.’
Drama will build your child’s confidence and self-esteem. Each class works towards a live end of term performance. Our aim is to find a child’s hidden talent and help them build new skills.
